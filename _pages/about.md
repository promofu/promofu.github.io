This is the front page of my [Jekyll] powered website, based on the fantastic
 [academicpages template] and hosted on [GitHub pages].

The idea is to offer some insights on my Projects and Coding Life in general
 using a data driven approach... so stay curious, stay tuned.

A data-driven personal website ?

... I'll get into that in some Blog Post soon...
