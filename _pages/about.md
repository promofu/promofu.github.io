This is the front page of a website that is powered by the fantastic
 [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on
 [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com).

The idea is to offer some insights on my GitHub Projects using a data driven approach... so stay
 curious, stay tuned.

A data-driven personal website

I'll get into that in some Blog Post soon...

Some more info might eventually pop up [here](https://promofu.net).
