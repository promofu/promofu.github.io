This is the front page of a website that is powered by the fantastic
 [academicpages template] and hosted on [GitHub pages].

The idea is to offer some insights on my GitHub Projects using a data driven
 approach... so stay curious, stay tuned.

A data-driven personal website

I'll get into that in some Blog Post soon...
