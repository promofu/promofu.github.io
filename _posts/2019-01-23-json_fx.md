I came about a nice tool for CLI processing of JSON structures... native JavaScript,
fast and intuitive from a modern JavaScript perspective.

Cool stuff... depending on how much You are into JavaScript development I recommend
doing the following right now and give it a base jump:

```shell
.> npm install -g fx

.> echo '{"foo": [{"bar": "value"}]}' | fx 'x => x.foo[0].bar'
value

.> echo '{"foo": [{"bar": "value"}]}' | fx 'x => x.foo[0]'
{
  "bar": "value"
}
```

but the coolest by far is this:

```shell
.> echo '{"foo": "bar"}' | fx '{...this, "ping": "pong"}'
{
  "foo": "bar",
  "ping": "pong"
}
```

... but so much for ruthless c'n'p-ing ... credits to the original author and
